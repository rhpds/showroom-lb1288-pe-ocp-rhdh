. Click the *Choose* button on the *Quarkus Service*. The *Software Templates* screen will be displayed.
. You'll be prompted to enter a set of application parameters. Thankfully, defaults are provided by the template, so you can simply click *Next*.
. When prompted to *Provide Image Registry Information*:
  * Select the *Quay* image registry.
  * Enter your Quay password: `{common_password}`
  * Click *Next*.
+
NOTE: Your username is automatically determined by the Template using your current session.
. Select the default *Repository Location* and click *Review*.

. Confirm you're satisfied with your parameters and click *Create*.

Click the *Open Component in catalog* link to view the new Component. You'll see links to the GitLab repository (*View Source* link) and note that you're listed as the owner since you created the Component.

Wait for the build to complete, and visit the https://quay.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/user/dev1/[dev1 organization in Quay]. You'll be able to view the new _my-quarkus-app_ repository and see the newly pushed _latest_ image tag.

In the next section you'll learn how to enable and disable different plugin integrations with your Components, using OpenShift GitOps (Argo CD) as an example.
