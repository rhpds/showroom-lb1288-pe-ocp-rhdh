== Developer Activity: Update a Component's Catalog Info

include::../style.adoc[]

Installing the Argo CD plugin doesn't automatically make the deployment information visible when viewing Components in the Software Catalog. An `argocd/app-selector` annotation must be added to the Component's YAML definition. This annotation instructs the Argo CD plugin to fetch the information related to the Component from the Argo CD instance you configured.

IMPORTANT: Please ensure you are logged in as a Developer with dev1/{common_password} as you were guided to in a previous step.

Update your Quarkus application's _catalog-info.yaml_ with the correct annotation:

. Visit the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/dev1/my-quarkus-app/-/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml[dev1/my-quarkus-app/catalog-info.yaml, window="gitlab"] file in GitLab.
. Select _Edit > Edit single file_.
. Uncomment the following annotation:
+
----
argocd/app-selector: rht-gitops.com/rhdh-gitops=dev1-my-quarkus-app
----
. You can confirm this annotation is correct by visiting the https://rhdh-gitops-server-rhdh-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/rhdh-gitops/dev1-my-quarkus-app-dev[dev1-my-quarkus-app-dev in the rhdh-gitops instance, window="proj_argo"] and clicking the *Details* button to view the applied labels. You can login with `admin/{common_password}`

. Use the *Commit changes* button to commit the annotation.

. Return to your https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/my-quarkus-app[instance of {product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"] after committing the change to view the newly created `my-quarkus-app` Component. Use the *Schedule entity refresh* button to pull this change from Git to {product_name_rhdh} for your Quarkus application.

. Next, refresh your browser. The *CD* tab should appear, and you can view the ArgoCD Application's information.
