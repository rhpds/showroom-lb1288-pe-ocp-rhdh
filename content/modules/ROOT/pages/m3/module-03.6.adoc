== Platform Engineer Activity: Update the Component Template

include::../style.adoc[]

While the developer can add the necessary annotation to their Component, it's best to update the Template so future developers can benefit from the Argo CD integration without having to manually add the annotation.

// TODO
// To ensure that future Quarkus applications created using the Template...

=== Update the Quarkus Service template in GitLab

. Visit the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple/-/blob/main/skeleton/catalog-info.yaml[rhdh/template-quarkus-simple/skeleton/catalog-info.yaml,  window="gitlab"] file in GitLab.
. Select _Edit > Edit single file_.
. Uncomment the following in the `annotations` section of the file:
+
----
argocd/app-selector: rht-gitops.com/${{ values.gitops_namespace }}=${{ values.owner }}-${{values.component_id}}
----
+

. Use the *Commit changes* button to commit the new annotation.

The annotation value will be automatically generated, similar to the Argo CD label, using the values provided by developers when they use the Template.

=== Refresh the Quarkus Service template on {product_name_rhdh}

Return to your {product_name_rhdh} instance to view the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain/catalog/default/template/quarkus-web-template[quarkus-web-template^, window="rhdh"] after committing the change. Use the *Schedule entity refresh* button to pull this change from Git to {product_name_rhdh} for your Quarkus application. 

NOTE: Manually refreshing is an optional step, since {product_name_rhdh} will check for upstream Entity changes every few minutes.
