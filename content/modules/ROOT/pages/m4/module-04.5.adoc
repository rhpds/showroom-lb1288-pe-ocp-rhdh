* For the sake of the workshop, let us just make some changes to the README file. E.g., add this text to the README file `This service store provides the core services of Parasol web-app`

* Add a Commit Message *Chore: Improved README file* at the bottom of the page; make sure the Target Branch is `my-feature-branch`; Click *Commit changes*
* You can now close the GitLab browser.

=== View component on {product_name_rhdh}
* From {product_name_rhdh}, access `parasol-store-my-feature-branch` component https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store-my-feature-branch/ci[from here^, window="rhdh"] 
* Access the CI tab to view the pipeline
+
image:m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline1.png[width=80%]

* Very shortly, the pipeline will be marked as *Succeeded*
+
image:m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline-ok.png[width=80%]
+
NOTE: The first pipeline was triggered when you created this branch using the Software Template. and the next is by the Git commit.

* Once you are happy with the changes, you are now ready to create a merge request to the main branch.

* This is the end of the inner-loop within the isolated/sandboxed dev environment. In the next section, as a developer, you will create a merge request to the main branch to initiate the outer loop.
