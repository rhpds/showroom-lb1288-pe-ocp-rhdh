== Developer Activity: Work on feature-branch
include::../style.adoc[]


In this module, as a Developer you are tasked to make change to an existing service - the `parasol-store` service. You will create a feature branch of the repository and then work in an isolated environment that allows you to work independently without impacting other developers in your team. Once you are ready with the changes, you can raise a merge request to push your changes to main branch, and there progressing the changes to production deployment

Please make sure you are logged in as a *Developer* with `dev1/{common_password}`. If you are unsure how to, please refer to the below note.

.Click here to view instructions to login as the Developer.

== Create a feature-branch

. Click https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store[here to access the parasol-store^, window="gitlab"] repository.
. Click on the *(+)* button as shown in the screenshot below, and click on *New branch* menu
+

. Name the branch as `my-feature-branch` so as to make it easier to follow the rest of the instructions.
+

== Onboard the Feature Branch using template

. In {product_name_rhdh}, choose the *Create* side menu, and you will see the *Parasol Store Development* template. Click on *Choose*
+
image:m4/choose-parasol-store-template.png[width=30%]

. In *Step 1: Provide Information for the sandbox deployment*, enter the feature-branch name `my-feature-branch` or the name you have picked for your branch.
+

. In *Step 2: Provide database information*. Keep all the fields as they are - no need to make changes. The parameters are already set based on the OpenShift Service names from the existing deployments of the application.
+

. Click on *Review*, and proceed to *Create*
+
image:m4/choose-parasol-store-template-step3.png[]

. Click on the *Open component on catalog* link
+

=== Explore the Component

. The newly created component for the isolated environment acts as a single pane of glass to perform most of the acivities as a developer
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-component-laanding.png[width=90%]

. Notice that under the *CI* tab, a pipeline is in progress.
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-first-pipeline.png[]
. The pipeline turns green when it finishes the run successfully
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-first-pipeline-success.png[]

. Explore the other tabs to see how {product_name_rhdh} provides a single pane of glass for the Developer's isolated dev environment.
.. The *Overview* tab provides easy access to the sourcecode and deployments
.. The *Topology* tab provides a window to the deployment on OpenShift
.. The *Issues and Pull/Merge Requests* tabs provide insights about the GitLab repo
.. *CI* tab shows an easy view of the pipeline in both OpenShift (Tekton based pipeline), and on GitLab
.. The *CD* tab shows the deployed components/systems in the namespace using ArgoCD plugin


=== View the  deployment on OpenShift

. To view the deployment on OpenShift, https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/ns/parasol-store-my-feature-branch/deployments/parasol-store[click here^, window="console"].

[NOTE]
====
Login to OpenShift using the `htpasswd` provider and the credentials `admin` / `{common_password}`.

== Add features to the application

. Click on the *< > View Source* button on the {product_name_rhdh} https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Component Overview page^, window="rhdh"] to access the source repository of `parasol-store`.
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-component-overview.png[]

. Switch to the *my-feature-branch* 
+
image:m4/parasol-switchbranch.png[width=60%]

. The feature request is to provide a REST API call endpoint that returns the total number of available products. For the purposes of this workshop, we will (once again) uncomment some code.
. Changes are needed in the `parasol-store> src> main> java> org> parasol> retail> store> catalog> rest> CatalogResource.java` file. You can click https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store/-/blob/my-feature-branch/src/main/java/org/parasol/retail/store/catalog/rest/CatalogResource.java[here^, window="gitlab"] to directly access this file on GitLab.
. Select *Edit > Edit single file*. If prompted, login with `dev1/{common_password}`.
+
image:m4/parasol-webide.png[]

. Right at the bottom of this file, you will find the `getProductCount()` method that's been commented out.
+
image:m4/parasol-commented-prodcount.png[width=85%]
. Carefully delete the these two lines:  `/* DELETE THIS COMMENT LINE` and `DELETE THIS COMMENT LINE */`. This will remove the comments.
. After deletion, the file should look like this
+
image:m4/parasol-un-commented-prodcount.png[]

. Add a Commit Message *Chore: Add ProdCount REST API call* at the bottom of the page; make sure the Target Branch is `my-feature-branch`; Click *Commit changes*
. You can now close the GitLab browser.

== View `parasol-store` component on {product_name_rhdh}

. Navigate to `parasol-store-my-feature-branch` component https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store-my-feature-branch/ci[from your {product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"] 
. Access the *CI tab* to view the pipeline.  You will see a new pipeline being triggered for the change you just made.
+
image:m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline1.png[width=80%]
. Shortly, the pipeline will be marked as *Succeeded*
+
image:m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline-ok.png[width=80%]
+
NOTE: The first pipeline was triggered when you created this branch using the Software Template, and the next is by the Git commit.
. Once you're happy with the changes, you can proceed to create a merge request to the main branch.


== Conclusion

In this module you learnt how Software Templates and plugins can accelerate developer productivity. With {product_name_rhdh}, developers have access to all the necessary tools via a single pane of glass, reducing cognitive load.

This marks the end of the inner loop within the isolated/sandboxed development environment. In the next section, you will create a merge request to the main branch to initiate the outer loop.
