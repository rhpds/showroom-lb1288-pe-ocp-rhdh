== Platform Engineer Activity: Template to Setup Dev Environment

include::../style.adoc[]

When developers are assigned a JIRA/task/feature to enhance an application, they begin with a feature-branch on Git. Developers will continue to work on this _feature-branch_ till the time they are ready to merge their changes to the main branch. Creating an isolated dev environment for these developers to help in in a continuous inner-loop, helps to accelerate developer productivity. 

The Platform Engineer creates a new S/W template that can setup an isolated dev environment for the Developers, who are in this case working on the  `parasol-store` application. The template performs a number of things:

* Creates a namespace within OpenShift for the developer
* This  isolated dev environment connects to the *developer* DB instance running on OpenShift
* Sets up a development pipelines to make development easy 
* Creates GitOps/Argo manifests within the user's repo

With this, the Platform Engineers are able to provide this environment that allows the developer to just focus on coding. The templates make it easy for developers to set up _isolated dev environments repeatedly in a self-service fashion_, thereby rapidly increased developer productivity.
