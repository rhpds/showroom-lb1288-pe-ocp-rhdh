== Platform Engineer Activity: Setup an Isolated Dev Environment on OpenShift

include::../style.adoc[]

When developers are assigned a JIRA task or feature to enhance an application, they start by creating a *feature branch* on Git. They continue working on this branch until their changes are ready to be merged into the main branch. Providing an _isolated development environment_ for these developers enables a continuous inner loop, enhancing productivity and accelerating development.

The Platform Engineer creates a new Software Template to set up an isolated development environment for Developers working on the `parasol-store` application. This template performs several tasks:

* Creates a dedicated namespace within OpenShift for the developer
* Connects the isolated development environment to the *dev* DB instance running on OpenShift
* Sets up development pipelines to build and deploy the developer's changes in the environment
* Generates GitOps/Argo manifests to manage CI/CD for the developer's environment

With this approach, the Platform Engineers enable developers to just focus on coding. The templates simplify the set up of these isolated dev environments in a self-service manner. This allows the developers to create them repeatedly and easily, thereby rapidly increasing developer productivity.
